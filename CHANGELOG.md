# Changelog

All notable changes to `tron2-mujoco-sim` will be documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `tron2_sim/` variant-registry package: robot selection is now
  data-driven (`tron2_sim/variants/{sf,wf,da,dach,dasf}.py`) instead of
  hard-coded in `simulator.py`. Supported robot types expanded from two
  (`SF_TRON2A`, `WF_TRON2A`) to ten: `SF`, `WF`, `DA`, `DACH`, `DASF`,
  each in a `TRON2A` and a `TRON2B` variant.
- `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`: the runtime environment is now managed
  with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). `uv sync --extra sdk` installs
  everything; a documented pip installation path remains available
  alongside it.
- Startup capability guard: the simulator now fails immediately with a
  readable message when the installed `limxsdk` lacks the `*ForSim`
  methods a robot type needs, instead of raising `AttributeError` on
  the first publish.
- Asset path fallback: models are located under either
  `robot-description/<tron2a|tron2b>/<TYPE>/xml/` or the flat
  `robot-description/tron2/<TYPE>/xml/`, easing the asset-repo
  transition.
- Support matrix in the README stating, per robot type, which upstream
  SDK and asset versions are required.
- `doc/gif/`: per-variant demo animations (`SF_TRON2A.gif`,
  `WF_TRON2A.gif`, `DACH_TRON2A.gif`, `DASF_TRON2A.gif`).
- Open-source scaffolding: `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `.gitignore` covering Python build artefacts (`__pycache__/`,
  `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`,
  `*.egg-info/`), uv/simulator-specific artefacts (`MUJOCO_LOG.TXT`,
  `asset_converter/`), editor / OS junk, and an explicit deny-list for
  run-time artefacts that must not be committed here (`*.onnx`,
  `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.ckpt`, `*.so`, `*.dll`, `*.dylib`, `*.lib`,
  `*.whl`, `*.bag`, `*.mcap`).
- GitHub CI workflow: `uv lock --check`, Python byte-compile
  (`python -m py_compile`), `ruff` lint, a "no second messaging stack"
  check (bans importing `mros`), submodule status non-empty check,
  optional MuJoCo import smoke test, EXIF sanity scan on doc images,
  private-IP scan with allowlist, and a deny-list check that fails
  on any committed `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.onnx`, `*.pt`,
  `*.so`, `*.dll`, `*.whl`, or `*.bag`.
- Issue templates and PR template under `.github/`; the PR template
  includes an explicit **submodule-pin-update** checkbox.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` with maintainers / legal / SDK / sim /
  robotics team routing, extended to cover `tron2_sim/`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `.python-version`.
- `README.md`: SPDX header, "License & attribution" block, "Scope /
  not included" (with submodule init note and pointer to the
  external `tron2-rl-deploy-python` ONNX repository), "Verification"
  section, and "Cite & support" block with `contact@limxdynamics.com`.

### Changed
- **Communication is now limxsdk-only.** Every channel of every
  supported robot type runs over the SDK `*ForSim` API. The previous
  dual-stack arrangement, where channels the SDK did not cover fell
  back to a separate messaging library, is gone.
- `gripper_config.yaml` moved to `tron2_sim/config/`, next to the
  loader that reads it; `tron2_sim/config.py` became the
  `tron2_sim/config/` package, so the `from ..config import
  load_gripper_config` import is unchanged. `GRIPPER_CONFIG` still
  overrides the path.
- Comments, docstrings and runtime messages are in English.
- Submodule pins bumped to current public commits: `limxsdk-lowlevel`
  to `70ff83c22f5f54a07c2ddf7e32a2c6ffb1d2ebc7` and
  `robot-description` to `9939c22e69d27653ec0ba8a505859a2903dd1a71`
  (`https://github.com/limxdynamics/tron2-robot-description.git`,
  branch `main`).
- `README.md`, `README_zh-CN.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  and the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` note now consistently
  describe `<robot-ip>` as a placeholder token that users substitute
  with their own robot / simulator IP. No production or
  internal-network IP is embedded in this repository.

### Removed
- The `SFYG`, `WFYG` and `DASF2` robot types, whose arm and rear-body
  channels have no SDK equivalent.
- The bundled non-SDK messaging wheels and every module that depended
  on them: base-pose ground truth, teleoperation target markers, and
  the dexterous-hand module (which no shipped asset had joints for, so
  it never activated).
- `tools/` and the two root-level test clients; their role is taken
  over by CI.
- Committed `__pycache__/*.pyc` files that had been accidentally
  tracked despite `.gitignore` already covering `__pycache__/`.

### Fixed
- The previous `limxsdk-lowlevel` submodule pin referenced a commit
  predating the `*ForSim` API, so a fresh
  `git clone --recurse-submodules` produced a checkout that could not
  run any robot type. The pin now points at a public commit that
  supports it.
- `simulator.py` exits through `os._exit(0)` to dodge a teardown race
  in the SDK's native layer, which also skipped flushing buffered
  streams: all output was discarded whenever stdout was a pipe or a
  file. Streams are now flushed first.

### Blocked on upstream
- `DASF_TRON2B` needs the public asset repository to publish a
  `tron2b/` DASF model.

### Resolved (2026-07-16)
- **Private-IP handling** — resolved 2026-07-16 per owner decision.
  All Markdown / YAML command examples now use `<robot-ip>` as a
  placeholder token. No production IP is embedded in this
  repository. The sibling `tron2-rl-deploy-ros` retains a
  documentation-example literal `10.192.1.2` in its source / launch
  files, declared in that repo's `SECURITY.md`.

### Pending owner sign-off (blocks first public tag)
- **Submodule clearance — `robot-description`.** Pin now points at
  `9939c22e69d27653ec0ba8a505859a2903dd1a71` on branch `main` of
  `github.com/limxdynamics/tron2-robot-description`. Anonymous
  `git clone --recurse-submodules` succeeds. The **license
  (expected Apache-2.0 per the sibling repo `NOTICE`) and
  re-distribution terms** still require legal / mechanical owner
  sign-off before the first public tag. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` §2.
- **Submodule clearance — `robot-joystick`.** Confirm the pinned
  commit (`30f69a9…`), the license, and whether the submodule ships
  pre-built binaries subject to additional terms.
- **Submodule clearance — `limxsdk-lowlevel`.** Confirm the license
  and re-distribution terms for the wheels under
  `python3/{amd64,aarch64}/limxsdk-*.whl` at pin `70ff83c2…`.
- **Documentation media.** EXIF strip and content review of
  `doc/deploy.jpg`, `doc/sf.GIF`, `doc/wf.GIF`, the two
  `doc/*mj-*.gif` legacy simulation captures, and the new
  `doc/gif/*.gif` per-variant captures — including publication
  clearance from every identifiable person visible in the
  real-world deploy photo.
- **Linked external repository.** Confirm that
  `tron2-rl-deploy-python` will be published under the
  `limxdynamics` organization and that referencing its model paths
  in `README.md` is safe.

## [0.1.0] — TBD

First public release. Contents:

- `simulator.py` + `tron2_sim/`: MuJoCo simulator bridging LimX SDK
  `RobotCmd` (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `Kp`, `Kd`) to `mujoco.MjData` for the
  `SF`, `WF`, `DA`, `DACH`, and `DASF` variants (`TRON2A`/`TRON2B`).
- Three git submodules (`robot-description`, `robot-joystick`,
  `limxsdk-lowlevel`) — pinned by commit, not vendored.
- Documentation under `doc/` and `README.md`.
